I worked with the TA and was abe to get my github to work and I can post to github pages with a build
I am very close to make my tic tac to game. 
I was able to use CSS to make a 3 by 3 grid of boxes
and the grid has a cordinate system I can ues to map data. 
I have a much better understanding of the useState system.
I was able to change the color of the boxes with onClick command which will be useful in making turn for tic tac toe
