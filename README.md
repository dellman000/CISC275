# Change Log

My attempt to make React work is linked [here](https://github.com/dellman000/CISC275-testing)

 Tutrials I used to get git hub working

 2. [2](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)

I worked with the TA and was abe to get my github to work and I can post to github pages with a build

Issues with React
  1. getting the react project to work with Github pages 
  2. understanding props, and containers  
  3. getting my computer to do a successful push and pull

# To DO
1. Goal is to make a 3D tick tac toe game 
2. learn how to make better-looking websites using CSS and bootstrap
3. Animating sprites in JS or TS
4. should use typescript more than javascript
5. should turn this read me into HTML code
6. build an outline of the UI
